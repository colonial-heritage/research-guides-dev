  KKZ) was founded in 1816 by King Willem I. The collection contained various objects

  content: "### History of the collection\n\nThe Royal Cabinet of Curiosities was\
    \ a museum in The Hague, founded in 1816 by [King Willem I](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2079957).\
    \ The museum took the form of a cabinet of curiosities and its collection comprised\
    \ a wide array of objects, including many from Dutch and other powers\u2019 colonies.\
    \ Ultimately, it housed all sorts: objects related to Dutch history, Asian [applied\
    \ arts](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11840/termmaster10049837), [ethnographic\
    \ objects](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11840/termmaster10068984), and [naturalia](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11840/termmaster10049008).\n\
    \n\nThe basis of the collection was formed by Chinese and Japanese objects collected\
    \ by [Jean Theodore Royer](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34232414), a preacher\
    \ and lawyer with a fascination for Chinese language and literature who amassed\
    \ a large collection of prints, paintings and documents, [Jan Cock Blomhoff](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1973328),\
    \ among other things a warehouse manager at the Dutch trading post on the Japanese\
    \ peninsula [Dejima](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q640267), and [Johan van Overmeer\
    \ Fisscher](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q21549843), who also worked on Dejima.\
    \ [King Willem I](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2079957) subsequently contributed\
    \ the stadtholders\u2019 collections. In the course of its existence the museum\
    \ also received various donations and made acquisitions. Eventually the collection\
    \ comprised significant collections of Japanese and Chinese objects and numerous\
    \ items  \u2013 many of which were diplomatic gifts from the stadholders\u2019\
    \ collections \u2013 from Southeast Asia and the West African Gold Coast as well\
    \ as from North America and Oceania. \nThe museum was dissolved in 1883 and its\
    \ collection distributed among several museums. The majority went to the Rijks\
    \ Etnografisch Museum (now [Wereldmuseum Leiden](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F77c1a0cf982b33b9e88073c4a704049b)\
    \ and the [Nederlandsch Museum voor Geschiedenis en Kunst](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F0d0d07f9e69d73c961b30ffd357c1e47)\
    \ (subsumed into the Rijksmuseum). Small numbers of objects were transferred to\
    \ the [National Museum of Antiquities](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F732277d365ab6fbcc351da7bc2b900b3),\
    \ the [Koninklijk Kabinet van Munten, Penningen en Gesneden Stenen](https://rkd.nl/library/400001411),\
    \ the [Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2Fb897e22a1eae224b0ca13b5ec14d51cb),\
    \ the [Rijksmuseum van Geologie en Mineralogie](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7333956)\
    \ and the [Rijksherbarium](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2152927).\n\n### Provenance\
    \ research\n\nThe original records of the collection, created by the first director\
    \ [Reinier van de Kasteele](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q56097178), disappeared\
    \ after his son [Abraham van de Kasteele](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18507671)\
    \ succeeded him in 1840. Many objects also went missing or were lost during this\
    \ time. The third and final director [David van der Kellen](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5905167),\
    \ who took office in 1876, had to put things in order. As can be read in Rudolf\
    \ Effert's book (Volkenkundig Verzamelen, pp. 213-216), in 1876-1879 Van der Kellen\
    \ drew up a new inventory of objects, in which he attempted to link remaining\
    \ documentation to objects in the extensive collection. Mistakes were made in\
    \ this process.\n\nThe archive of the Royal Cabinet of Curiosities is held in\
    \ the [Noord-Hollands Archief](https://noord-hollandsarchief.nl/) as part of the\
    \ Rijksmuseum archive. It includes correspondence regarding donations and acquisitions.\
    \ The appendices include additional access with convenient overviews of this correspondence.\
    \ Please note that the KKZ\u2019s correspondence also relates to items that were\
    \ offered to the collection but were ultimately not acquired.\n\nIn addition,\
    \ archival documents are held at the [National Archives of the Netherlands](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/),\
    \ written by officials of the Ministry of the Interior. These relate to acquisitions,\
    \ as well as the dissolution of the Royal Cabinet of Curiosities and the distribution\
    \ of the collection among the various museums. The letter archive of the Ministry\
    \ of the Interior contains notes verbales and letters regarding submitted donations\
    \ and sales. These can be traced using the indices in the notes verbales.\n"
