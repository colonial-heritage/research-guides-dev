The provenance report:
  content: |
    "The purpose of the provenance report is to record both the research itself and the key data it produced. In doing so, it is important to provide the most comprehensive overview of the sources consulted, even if they did not reveal anything or contained conflicting information. Future provenance researchers can draw on this. This [checklist](link to pdf/page of checklist) provides an overview of possible points of interest. 
    
    A provenance report can take different forms. There are no official guidelines for reporting provenance research from, for example, the Dutch Museum Association or the ICOM. In institutions that manage collections, different forms of reporting are sometimes combined or used alongside each other.
    
    **Textual report**
    A textual report provides a comprehensive overview of the research. The structure depends on the purpose of the study. Various considerations regarding the content of a provenance are discussed in the publication [Clues](https://www.niod.nl/en/projects/pilotproject-provenance-research-objects-colonial-era-pproce). In this publication, various options are discussed, such as reporting using a defined research question or chronological order, and the extent of the historical contextualization. Examples of textual reports can be found on the website of the [NIOD](https://niod.on.worldcat.org/search?queryString=se%3A%20PPROCE%20provenance%20reports%20%3B&clusterResults=true&groupVariantRecords=false&page=1).
    
    **Schematic view**
    A schematic representation of provenance is useful to show the most important data at a glance. This can be in the form of a timeline showing key moments of property transitions or in the form of a provenance sentence: a standardized notation of known years, possessors and their places of residence, separated by punctuation. The schematic also includes possible gaps in the knowledge. 
    
    Example of such a provenance sentence:: *Gravestone [Aceh, 16th-18th century], unknown burial site in Lhoknga, until 1901; (removed from Lhoknga by George Nijpels, 1901); donated to Hoofdcursus, Kampen, 1902 to 1923; transfer to the Ethnographic Museum of the Royal Military Academy, Breda 1923 to 1956; transfer to Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde / Wereldmuseum Leiden, 1956.*
    
    Example of a timeline:
      - **16th century - 18th century** Manufacture of the gravestone.
      - **16th/18th century - before 1901** Cemetery in Lhoknga.
      - **1901** Removed from Lhoknga by George Nijpels.
      - **1902** Sent to the Netherlands by George Nijpels.
      - **1902-1923** Hoofdcursus of the Royal Military Academy in Kampen, after donation by George Nijpels.
      - **1923-1956** Etnographic Museum of the Royal Military Academy in Breda, after the transfer from the Hoofdcursus at Kampen.
      - **1956-heden** Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde / Wereldmuseum Leiden, after the transfer from the Royal Military Academy in Breda.
    
    **Connecting data**
    For museums, in addition to textual reporting, it is advisable to record the provenance data in their collection management systems by linking all persons and institutions associated with the provenance to the object. It is also useful to create links to specific events, if the collection management system offers this possibility. In this way, it is easier to browse and link the provenance data to external sources.
    
    **Images**
    Historical photographs, floor plans and other illustrations can illustrate the report. The same accounts for photographs of the object and its details. For example, decorations and inscriptions may contain important information. However, it is good to keep in mind that depicting and/or examining certain objects is sometimes considered undesirable by communities of origin. If such restrictions are suspected, it is advisable to seek expert advice. This applies in particular to ancestral remains. In addition, applicable copyright laws should be taken into account if the provenance report is made available to the public.
    
    **Language**
    Colonial sources are written from a perspective that justifies colonial rule. They often use terms that are no longer common or are considered inappropriate and offensive today. The search aide [Sources](link to zh Sources) provides guidance on dealing with outdated language found in colonial sources. When writing a report, it is important to cite historical words and terms - if necessary in quotation marks and accompanied by an explanation - if this is necessary to understand the object history and enable future research.
    
    The publication [Words Matter](https://amsterdam.wereldmuseum.nl/sites/default/files/2021-04/words_matter.pdf.pdf) by the Wereldmuseum provides tips for dealing with colonial teminology."
