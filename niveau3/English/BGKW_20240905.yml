    ### Description
    
    The Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen was founded in 1778. So the society endured several colonial administrations, the VOC, the French period, the British interregnum and finally the Dutch state again. In 1950, after Indonesian independence, the name of the society was changed to *Lembaga Kebudajaan Indonesia*, the Indonesian Cultural Institute. In 1962, the institute ceased to exist and its collection was incorporated into the National Museum of Indonesia, which still resides in the building where the Bataviaasch Genootschap moved to in 1867. The society's members mainly came from the upper echelons of the colonial administration in the former Dutch East Indies, so there were maintained close connections with the colonial authorities. There was also frequent contact with similar societies in the Netherlands, Dutch museums and scientists. In this way, the Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen developed into a pivotal figure in the cultural and scientific field within the Dutch East Indies.
    
    The aim of the Bataviaasch Genootschap was to promote the arts and sciences in the former Dutch East Indies, and in the early years of the society the focus was mainly on publishing scientific treatises on the territories colonised by the Netherlands in the Indonesian archipelago. Collecting objects was not yet a priority at that time. Besides the collection of objects handed down by the first president, [Jacobus Radermacher](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q945130), objects were only sparsely added to the ‘cabinet’, as the Society's museum was then called. It is only from 1835 onwards that the emphasis is increasingly placed on collecting various objects. Initially, the focus was on natural objects, but later more and more ethnological and archaeological objects were added to the collection. In 1843, it was even decided to transfer the natural history collection of the society to the Museum of Natural History in Leiden. Around the same time, a government decree stipulated that objects of archaeological value could no longer simply be shipped to the Netherlands. In 1858, that policy was tightened, causing the Bataviaasch Genootschap to act as custodian of collections obtained, whether or not as spoils of war, by the Dutch East Indies government. The collection of the Bataviaasch Genootschap thus increasingly took on the form of a museum.
    
    From 1878 onwards, it was obligatory for Dutch officials that all the objects they collected should first be sent to the Bataviaasch Genootschap, where a selection was made what was to be sent to the Netherlands and what was to be kept in Indonesia. This is the reason, for instance, that part of the so-called ‘Lombok treasure’, captured by the Royal Dutch East Indies Army during the Lombok War at the end of the nineteenth century, was included in the collection of the Bataviaasch Genootschap.
    
    As of 1779, the Bataviaasch Genootschap published scientific findings in *Verhandelingen van het Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen*, which was published on a regular basis and, from 1838, published by the society itself. In 1853, the society also founded the journal *Tijdschrift voor Indische taal- land- en volkenkunde*.The minutes of the society were also published since that time, in which often interesting information about the objects that were acquired can be found.
    
    ### Herkomstonderzoek
    
    The collection of the Bataviaasch Genootschap was incorporated into the collection of the National Museum of Indonesia, [Museum Nasional Indonesia](https://www.museumnasional.or.id/), after the disbanding of the society in 1962. The society's archive is accessible through the [Arsip Nasional Republik Indonesia](https://anri.go.id/), the National Archives of Indonesia. The inventory can be downloaded from the website and accessed by searching for ‘Bataviaasch Genootschap’, the inventory is in Bahasa Indonesia. 
    
    As described, the minutes of the Bataviaasch Genootschap contain much information about objects offered and acquired by the society. The minutes from 1864 to 1922 are available through the [University Library](http://hdl.handle.net/1887.1/item:1112865) of Leiden University. Hans Groot's book *Van Batavia naar Weltevreden* also contains several detailed descriptions of objects acquired by the Bataviaasch Genootschap.
