    The Wereldmuseum Rotterdam was founded in 1885 by the municipality of Rotterdam. The museums holds a large collection of objects from Asia, the Pacific, Afrika and the Americas. The basis of the museum's collection finds it's origin in the collection that was established by the members of the former Yacht Society of Rotterdam.

    ### Description
    
    Today's Wereldmuseum Rotterdam grew out of the Yacht Society (Yachtvereniging), founded in 1851, which was located on the Willemskade in Rotterdam. Members donated all kinds of objects to the society, such as ship models, but also ethnographic objects. Thus, in 1873 the [Maritiem Museum Prins Hendrik](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2755458) was founded, named after the president of the Yacht Society. When [Prince Hendrik](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q705129) died in 1879 and the Yacht Club ceased to exist in 1880, the municipality of Rotterdam decided in 1883 to take over the building on the Willemskade and establish an ethnographic museum there. The desire for such a museum arose from, among other things, the Netherlands' overseas trade contacts, the emerging ethnological sciences and the increasing missionary and evangelising work in the Dutch colonial territories. In 1885, the collection of the former Prince Hendrik Maritime Museum was also acquired, after which the new museum opened its doors on 1 May of that year.
    
    The collection of the Museum voor Land- en Volkenkunde initially consisted of all kinds of donations from sailors, traders and military personnel, among others. The donation of the collection of Javanese batiked textiles and other items by [Elie van Rijckevorsel](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q52155329), who later also took a seat on the Advisory Board of the museum, served as an encouragement to the municipality of Rotterdam to establish the ethnographic museum. From the beginning of the twentieth century there was, under the notion of the upcoming science of anthropology, more structured collecting. This included the organization of collecting trips. Much focus was given to the cultures on New Guinea.
    
    It was not until 1961 that the Museum of Ethnology and the Maritiem Museum Prins Hendrik continued separately. Today, these are still separate municipal museums, but since the 1980s the collections of both museums are stored in the same depot. Since May 2017, the Wereldmuseum Rotterdam became part of the [National Museum of World Cultures](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17153751) (NMVW) association. The museum's collection, however, is still in possesion of the municipality of Rotterdam. Since 2023, all museums within the NMVW continued under the name Wereldmuseum. The name of the museum in Rotterdam was thus specified to Wereldmuseum Rotterdam.
