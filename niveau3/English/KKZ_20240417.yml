    ### Description
    
    The Royal Cabinet of Curiosities was a museum in The Hague, founded in 1816 by [King Willem I](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2079957). The museum took the form of a cabinet of curiosities, and its collection consisted of various objects, including many from the colonies. Ultimately, it housed a wide array of items: objects related to Dutch history, Oriental [decorative arts](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11840/termmaster10049837), [ethnographic objects](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11840/termmaster10068984), and [naturalia](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11840/termmaster10049008).
    
    At its foundation were the collections of Chinese and Japanese objects from [Jean Theodore Royer](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34232414), [Jan Cock Blomhoff](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1973328), and [Johan van Overmeer Fisscher](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q21549843). To these, the stadtholder collections were added by [King Willem III](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q125649). Throughout its existence, the museum received various donations and made acquisitions.
    
    In 1883, the museum was dissolved, and its collection was distributed among several museums. The majority went to the [Rijks Etnografisch Museum](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17339437) (nowadays the Wereldmuseum Leiden) and the [Nederlandsch Museum voor Geschiedenis en Kunst](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18015075) (which merged into the Rijksmuseum). Small numbers of objects were transferred to the [National Museum of Antiquities](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1860378), the [Koninklijk Kabinet van Munten, Penningen en Gesneden Stenen](https://rkd.nl/library/400001411), the [Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3432011), the [Rijksmuseum van Geologie en Mineralogie](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7333956), and the [Rijksherbarium](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2152927).
    
    ### Provenance research
    
    The original administration of the collection, created by the first director [Reinier van de Kasteele](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q56097178), disappeared after his son [Abraham van de Kasteele](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18507671) succeeded him in 1840. At that time, many objects disappeared or got lost as well. The third and final director, [David van der Kellen](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5905167), who took office in 1876, was assigned to put things in order.
    
    The archive of the Royal Cabinet of Curiosities is preserved in the [Noordhollands Archief](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3048702) as part of the Rijksmuseum archive. It contains, among other things, correspondence regarding donations and purchases. The appendices include detailed notes with convenient summaries of the correspondence. Please note that the KKZ correspondence also concerns items that were offered to the collection, but ultimately not purchased.
    
    Additionally, there are archival documents at the [Nationaal Archief](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2371154), written by officials from the Ministry of the Interior. These documents relate to acquisitions, as well as the dissolution of the Royal Cabinet of Curiosities and the distribution of the collection among various museums. Within the letter archive of the Ministry of the Interior, reports and letters can be found regarding offered donations and sales. These can be traced through the indices on the reports.
