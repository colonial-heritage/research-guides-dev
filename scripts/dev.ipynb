    "\n",
    " - the more you annotate _what_ the information in the guides _is_ (types, meta-info), the more information we can extract and potentially link together with the Datahub\n",
    " - try to keep structures _across_ guides of different levels _and_ pieces of information as uniform as possible\n",
    "   -> makes info _predictable_ for others and allows to link more into the Datahub\n",
    " - \n",
    "\n",
    "# Problems\n",
    "\n",
    " - which URIs?\n",
    "   -> definitely the Datahub ones _at some point_ but those aren't ready yet\n",
    "  - which thesaurus/thesauri?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Thoughts, Ideas\n",
