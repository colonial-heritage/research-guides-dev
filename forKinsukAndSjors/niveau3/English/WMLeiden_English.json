        "content": "### Description\n\nThe modern-day Wereldmuseum Leiden has a history in which the first hundred years are characterized by financial difficulties, the accumulation of large quantities of objects and many changes of location. In 1937, the museum finally found a permanent home in the former University Hospital where it could display its entire collection. Today, the museum is still located in this building. \n\nThe collection of the Wereldmuseum Leiden originated from the private collection of Philipp Franz von Siebold, also the museum's first director. His collection, which consisted mainly of Japanese objects was expanded during the 19th century to include several private collections and, in 1883, several ethnographic objects from the collection of the [Royal Cabinet of Curiosities](Link to RG KKZ). At the start of the twentieth century, part of the collection of the Museum of Antiquities in Leiden was also transferred to the then Rijks Etnografisch Museum. The latter group of objects included the various Singosari statues, some of which were returned to Indonesia in 1978 and others in 2023. On the other hand, objects were also transferred from the Ethnographic Museum to other museums, such as to the Anatomical Museum in Leiden in 1935. \n\nObjects were acquired in various ways. First, as described above, by exchange with other museums. In addition, the National Ethnographic Museum itself was an active buyer of ethnographic objects from dealers and auctions; part of the Museum's collection of Benin Bronzes, for example, were obtained in this way. Many objects were also received as donations, often from colonial officials or military personnel of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army (KNIL), for example. The vast majority of the collection of the present Wereldmuseum Leiden was therefore collected during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n### Provenance research\n\nThe Wereldmuseum Leiden has kept records of the collection since its founding. However, the archival system has changed several times and different documentation is available for each object or collection series (several pieces registered at the same time). \n\nThe archives can be roughly divided into the collection archive and the correspondence archive. The collection archive consists of object registers, inventories, series files and, for some older objects, lists of donations and exchanges. This archive can be found under NL-LdnRMV_A3. The correspondence archive contains incoming letters and telegrams, copies of outgoing letters, lists of incoming and outgoing correspondence, and so on. This archive can be found under NL-LdnRMV_A1.\n\nThe World Museum Leiden archive is not accessible online. For more information about the collection or to view archival records, contact <collectieinfo@wereldmuseum.nl>. \n\nDocuments related to the Wereldmuseum Leiden can also be found at the Dutch National Archives, these are mainly administrative records. In the archives of museums with which Wereldmuseum Leiden has exchanged collections, more archival material may be found regarding those specific objects.\n",
