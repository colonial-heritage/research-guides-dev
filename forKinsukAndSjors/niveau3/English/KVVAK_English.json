The KVVAK was founded on June 29, 1918 Asian art enthousiast [H.F.E. Visser (1890-1965)](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q83286861) and  collector and art dealer [G.J. Verburgt (1871-1926)](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84499681). According to the association's website, the aim is to give greater publicity to high quality [Asian art](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3399573), stimulate interest, and promote scholarship. The association's first president was [H.K. Westendorp](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q96749169) 1868-1941, who would later bequeath his own collection to the KVVAK. The association's collection currently comprises around 1,850 objects, consisting of various art forms such as [sculptures](http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300047090), Japanese [prints](http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300106750) and [ceramics](http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300310706). \n\nAfter some temporary exhibitions, around the tenth anniversary of the KVVAK, it was decided to raise a fund with which a collection and museum could be established. In 1932, the so-called \"Museum voor Aziatische Kunst\" opened in the Garden Hall of the [Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q924335). In 1952, the collection moved to the [Rijksmuseum](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q190804), of which it is still a part. Initially, the KVVAK's collection was exhibited in the [Drucker Extension](https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q25712476), which later merged into the current Philips Wing. After the Rijksmuseum's major renovation in 2013, the KVVAK's collection was housed in the [Asian Pavilion](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37769044). \n\nNote that not all of the Rijksmuseum's Asian art collection is on loan from the KVVAK; the museum itself also owns objects within this category. In addition to maintaining its own collection, the KVVAK organizes lectures and trips. In addition, the journal [Asian Art](ISSN: 2543-1749) is issued by Brill publishers.\n\n##Provenance research\nThe archive of the KVVAK is located within the Rijksmuseum's collection. To consult the archive, you need to contact the Rijksmuseum's collections department. In addition, the research library of the Rijksmuseum has a collection of publications, including catalogs of past exhibitions, that are of interest with regard to provenance research on the KVVAK collection.\n"}, {"content-type": "text/markdown"}], "Sources": {"Primary sources": [{"Type of source": "Archive", "Name": "NL-HaNA 2.14.73 663", "Description and remarks": "Records concerning the financial management of the Museum of East Asian Art at Amsterdam 1940-1960."}, {"Type of source": "Archive", "Name": "NL-HaNA 2.14.73 674", "Description and remarks": "Records concerning the acquisition of art works and the housing of the collection of the Museum voor Oost-Aziatische Kunst at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, 1947-1960."}, {"Type of source": "Archive", "Name": "NL-HaNA 2.14.73 6609", "Description and remarks": "Records concerning to a grant to the Museum van Aziatische Kunst in Amsterdam, 1942-1964."}, {"Type of source": "Archive", "Name": "NL-HaNA 2.27.19 2934", "Description and remarks": "Records concerning the approval of loan agreements of objects between the Rijksmuseum and the Asian Art Society in the Netherlands, 1970 - 1971."}, {"Type of source": "Archive", "Name": "NL-HaNA 2.24.25 554-555", "Description and remarks": "Photographs of the Aziatische Kunst exhibition at the Museum voor Aziatische Kunst in 1936.
