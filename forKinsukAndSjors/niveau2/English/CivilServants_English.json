        "content": "### Description\n\nCivil servants were appointed to govern the Dutch colonies. Especially in the former [Dutch East Indies](https://sws.geonames.org/1643084) and [Suriname](https://sws.geonames.org/3382998) there were many civil servants, who were managed from the Netherlands. Among them were not only officials for the administration, but also for education, justice, tax administration, police, agriculture and other government services, for example, the Kantoor voor Inlandse Zaken (the Office for Domestic Affairs), the meteorological service, and the archaeological service.\n\nThe administrative structure differed from colony to colony, with the position of 'gouverneur(-generaal)' being a commonality. The administrative structure of a colony can be found in the research guide on that particular colony. It is important to note that during the French domination of the European Netherlands, most of the Dutch colonial territory came under English administration. Therefore, you may come across English names relating to civil servants in archives from the period between, say, 1795 and 1820. An example is [Thomas Stamford Raffles](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q130327), who was governor of the former Dutch East Indies between 1811 and 1816.\n\nA significant part of the objects in Dutch collections come from civil servants and other persons who were in colonial government service. From 1862, government officials in the Dutch East Indies were encouraged to build up collections and send them to the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences (https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-guide/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F879aa24d509fdae582d9cbd6cc60160c). This society would then distribute the objects between its own museum and museums in the Netherlands. In practice, this never amounted to much and civil servants decided for themselves what they did with the objects in their possession.\n\n### Provenance research\n\nMany Dutch nationals, as well as colonial subjects, were employed in public service in the colonies. It is therefore recommended to check whether a person associated with the provenance of an object appears in the personnel files. The National Archives offers various [research aids](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoekhulpen) to guide you through their archives. \n\nColonial officials frequently changed positions and places of employment. The position listed in the object documentation may be different from the position at the time of acquisition. Staff books in the National Archives and almanacs issued by the government are reliable sources for finding out the position at the time of acquisition. Through the digitized newspapers on [Delpher.nl](https://www.delpher.nl/), information about the work of the civil servant in question can be retrieved.\n\nThe research guide [The Colonial State 1854-1942](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/archief/2.14.97/invnr/10ED/file/Koloniale%20staat.pdf) contains detailed explanations of the archives relating to the Dutch East Indies and the various civil service departments. A glossary (https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoekhulpen/militaire-stamboeken-afkortingen-en-verklarende-woordenlijst) explains the abbreviations used in the studbooks.\n\nThe archives of the Dutch colonial government can largely be found in the [Dutch National Archives](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/) in The Hague. There also remain archives in former colonised countries.\n\nEach year the Dutch government issued an almanac listing all officials in the colonies. For the former Dutch East Indies, there was the \"Almanak en naamregister van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb\" (1817-1864) and \"Regeeringsalmanak voor Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb\" (1865-1939). For Suriname and the other former West Indian colonies, there was the \"Surinaamsche Almanak\", published by the Paramaribo Department of the \"Maatschappij tot Nut van 't Algemeen\" (1820-1913), and \"De vraagbaak: almanak voor Suriname\" (1912-1955).\n\nStarting in 1848, the Dutch government reported every year on the state of affairs in the various colonies through the Colonial Report. This contained important events as well as a variety of statistical data. It is a useful source for mapping the context around the acquisition of objects. The report appeared until 1931 as an Appendix to the Acts of the States General, from 1869/70 as a permanent Appendix C, and under various names: Mededeelingen betreffende de Koloni\u00ebn (over 1848); Verslag van het beheer en den staat der Koloni\u00ebn (1849-1865); Koloniaal Verslag (1866-1923); Verslag van bestuur en staat van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb, Suriname en Cura\u00e7ao (1924-1930). As separate publications: Indisch Verslag (1931-1939) and Report of Administration and State of Suriname, Cura\u00e7ao and the Netherlands Antilles (1931-after 1940), respectively.\n\nPersonal archives of some Dutch nationals in government service have been preserved, containing, for example, diaries, memoirs, correspondence and reports. Such private archives can be found at numerous records offices in the Netherlands. It is therefore recommended to begin the search at [www.archieven.nl](https://www.archieven.nl/). However, not all archive services can be found here, so it is often necessary to continue the search outside this website. Many personal archives of officials in colonial service can be found at the Leiden University Libraries (KITLV archive) and the National Archives. Sometimes there are still archives in private possession.\n",
